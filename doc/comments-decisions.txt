cheng and wallace --> 10day lowpass filter // climatological-mean anual cycle is define as the mean plus the first thre hamronics of a 365-day time series consisting of the 40-year averages of the 500hPa height for each calender day
-----> !!!!!!! but 5-day intervals data of 500hPa gph (winter)!!!!!

michelangeli --> daily data winter --> no filtering --> nothing found to anomalies calc


rust 2010 -->  winter --> The SLP anomalies are obtained as differences to a spline-smoothed mean annual cycle for every grid point, calculated by averaging over the 26 yr used.

casado --> unfilter winterdata --> daily means --> anomalies not described--> propably climatological over whole winter

vautard 1990 --> different approaches --> daily winter data --> filtered with 10 day low pass and unfiltered --> nothing found to anomalies (onlay removal of grand mean so I guess again all data)

cassou --> winter daily --> but not filter --> anomalies again not described
